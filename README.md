# Inkoop-JS-challenge

A JS program to generate a game result based on given parameters 

We can do this by three methods:
 1. Push an element into an array each time, then calculate the length of the array. (Naive algorithm, takes up more space)
 2. Simple addition based arithmetic. (Comparatively better)
 3. A subtraction based arithmetic. (Best one, fewer lines of code, lesser comparisons) 

I have implemented the last two algorithms. The first one is a thought experiment that can be implemented very easily.
